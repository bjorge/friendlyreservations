	##### Setting up on an account in google cloud #####
		get a domain <yourdomain> from google
		start a g suite account with google with a single noreply@<yourdomain> account
		transfer the domain to your new g suite account (if not already there)
		go to https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/quickstart to setup a new project
			example name project frbeta1
			select the region for the project
			signup for free $300 trial (if available)
			after following instructions upload and test
			first you should see your account:
			$ gcloud auth list
				Credentialed Accounts
				ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
				*       noreply@<yourdomain>

			check that your project is setup:
			$ gcloud config set project frbeta1
				Updated property [core/project].
			$ gcloud config list
				[core]
				account = noreply@<yourdomain>
				disable_usage_reporting = False
				project = frbeta1

				Your active configuration is: [default]

		go to appengine settings for project, set max daily spending limit and authorized email as noreply@<yourdomain>
			otherwise the logs will show: 		Error sending mail: API error 3 (mail: UNAUTHORIZED_SENDER): Unauthorized sender
		add an spf record to DNS for your domain (see https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786)
			you should see "Enabled: MX Records, DKIM Signing, and SPF Validation" in google DNS settings for <yourdomain>
		deploy to the project and create a property and then create a reservation and make sure you get an email

		setup your domain https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/mapping-custom-domains
		in the appengine setting map the domain to either the top level or a subdomain
			the dns changes may take a while...
